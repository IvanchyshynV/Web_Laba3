              Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the San Francisco
              Bay Area. He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through
              India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.

          In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He insisted on applying only to Reed
          although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford. Jobs soon befriended Robert
          Friedland, who was Reed's student body president at that time. Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he
          was at Reed. He later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she
          refused.

        Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from
        a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which resulted in respiratory
        arrest. He had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side.
        His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables,
        repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children,
        then at his life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh
        wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" He then lost consciousness and died several hours later. A small private funeral was
        held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Jobs's family, were not made public.
